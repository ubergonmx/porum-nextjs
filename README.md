## Other

### View database

Simply run the following command to open Drizzle Studio. If you have any issues, check this [solution](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-postgresql/issues/112#issuecomment-579712540)

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

### Vercel Build Cache

`Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/vercel/path0/.next/export-detail.json'`

The solution is to simply add to the environment variables:
`VERCEL_FORCE_NO_BUILD_CACHE: 1`

### Full reset database

Go to local.drizzle.studio after running `npm run db:studio`, paste the following into SQL Runner and then execute:

```
DO $$
DECLARE
  r RECORD;
BEGIN
  FOR r IN (SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public') LOOP
      EXECUTE 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.' || quote_ident(r.tablename) || ' CASCADE';
  END LOOP;
END $$;
```

Run `npm run db:push` to create the necessary tables to PostgreSQL.
